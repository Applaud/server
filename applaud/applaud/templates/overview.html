	<h2>What is Apatapa?</h2>
	<p>Apatapa is a mobile application and a website, designed to allow users to interact with their location.</p>

	<h2>The Apatapa Team</h2>
	<div id="wyatt" class="team-person">
	  <h3>Wyatt Hayman - CEO</h3>
	  <p>At Oberlin, I had the opportunity to cultivate my leadership skills as the only captain of the Oberlin Men’s Varsity Soccer Team.  Having taken math through differential equations and a year of foundational computer science, I feel very comfortable solving technical problems.  Among other values, college was an entrepreneurial launchpad for me.  While at Oberlin I submitted four business ideas for funding.  After receiving $1500 to pursue a patent, I received $30,000 in seed funding from Oberlin to start Apatapa.  I selected Apatapa from an archive of over 600 business ideas that I developed throughout college.  After beginning work on Apatapa in September, I formed a diverse, highly technical, and extremely driven team.  My dream is to use entrepreneurial success to inspire large-scale, self-sustaining, social and environmental progress.  I continue working to establish a daily meditation practice as I explore the power of the brain; In 2010 I participated in a month-long silent meditation retreat that informs me every day.</p>

	  <h3>Jack Kearney - CTO</h3>
	  <p>I love building things. But I also feel compelled to construct. When I was little I used LEGOs; as I grew a bit older I started to use 2x4s and rope to make tree forts and zip lines; finally, in college I realized that this love extended beyond the purely tangible. I started a transportation service at Oberlin that took kids to and from New York. Even though this wasn’t strictly construction, creating something that a lot of people used was awesome! Around that same time, I took my first computer science class. From this I realized that starting a tech company was a perfect blend of hands-on building and entrepreneurship.  I’m thrilled by the prospect of a lot of people using something that I’ve helped to build.</p>

	  <h3>Shahab Raza - COO</h3>
	  <p>Having found myself as an 18-year-old far, far away from home in such a drastically different culture, it’s not so surprising that my four years at Oberlin were incredibly formative. I have continued enjoying problem solving, but each problem is now accompanied by a broader pursuit of Objective Truth.</p>	  
	  <p>Sport has always been a massive part of my life. Indeed a large part of who I am – in regards to my drive and ambition, sensitivity working with other people, and comfort dealing with highs and lows - can be attributed to my time spent watching and playing.  I am in love with the game of soccer, the history, the expression of culture, the paradoxical harmony in chaos. I have missed only a handful of Arsenal games in the last five years. And a painful five years at that, so spare a thought.</p>

	  <p>I don’t think we live in especially troubled times. We’re just more aware of injustices – wrongs that need to be righted. Here’s to that pursuit.</p>
